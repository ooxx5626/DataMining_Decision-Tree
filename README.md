# DataMining_Decision-Tree

This project is running in ipython with jupyter

The data is generated by [數據生成.xlsx](https://github.com/ooxx5626/DataMining_Decision-Tree/blob/master/數據生成.xlsx)

## IF you are Teacher or TA
The input Data is in [input](https://github.com/ooxx5626/DataMining_Decision-Tree/tree/master/input) and there are two kind of data size and two type of data 

1. test

2. train

The output Data is in [output](https://github.com/ooxx5626/DataMining_Decision-Tree/tree/master/output)
Code is in [HW2.ipynb](https://github.com/ooxx5626/DataMining_Decision-Tree/blob/master/HW2.ipynb)
